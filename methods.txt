The dataset was created with a OnePlus 6 phone using the GCam against a mostly white background to reduce
noise/differences on the images. Data was captured by filming the individual cables at 30fps.
Every third frame was extracted from these videos and categorized into USB types.

Picking an estimator
We plan on starting with Linear SVC because of our small sample size. Based on performance of this
algorithm we might instead consider KNeighbors classifier.
